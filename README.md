##Demo app for Lilly's recruitment hackathon 2016

I learned Node, Express, and Handlebars over 2-3 days whilst making this demo app

The app attempts to address the issue of managing distribution of supplies after an earthquake

It pulls data from the US Geological Survey API and uses Leaflet.js for mapping.
